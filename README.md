# Weather Application Test Automation Project  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on automating the testing of a weather application that provides city-specific weather details, including current conditions and forecasts. The goal is to ensure the application's functionality, accuracy, and usability through automated testing tools like **Postman**, **Selenium**, and **Appium**.  

## Features Tested  
1. **City Search Functionality**: Verifies that users can search for valid cities and receive accurate weather details.  
2. **Error Handling**: Ensures proper error messages are displayed for invalid or empty inputs.  
3. **Weather Forecast Display**: Tests the correctness of forecast data for upcoming days.  
4. **Responsive Design**: Confirms the application functions smoothly across desktop and mobile devices.  

## Tools Used  
- **Postman**: API testing for GET requests and error scenarios.  
- **Selenium**: Automated testing of the web interface to validate search functionality and results display.  
- **Appium**: Testing the mobile version of the application for usability and performance.  

## Project Objectives  
- Validate the accuracy of weather details retrieved from the API.  
- Ensure the user interface is responsive and works seamlessly across devices.  
- Identify and handle edge cases such as invalid city names or empty inputs.  
- Provide a robust test automation suite to maintain application quality.  

## Repository Structure  
- **/api-testing**: Contains Postman collections and environment files.  
- **/web-testing**: Selenium scripts for testing the web interface.  
- **/mobile-testing**: Appium scripts for mobile application testing.  
- **/docs**: Test scenarios, test data, and reports.
